/** immutable. binary forest node, defined ONLY by its forest shape, with no data in each node
except caches which can be derived from that shape.
A 7 param universal pattern combinator
(aka combinator, universal lambda function, and pattern calculus function)
whose first param is isDirty (leaf is clean, any nonleaf means dirty, which will be cached to
swap between clean vs dirty in bigo1), and leaf itself is clean.
The other 6 params are mostly the same as in earlier wikibinator versions
but will reorder some opcodes and put in
(axiomop ret param func) being halted if (func param)->ret
and (axiomop ret param func ignore) does infloop and that "ignore" param is the 7th of 7 params,
so unlike earlier wikibinator versions, it can infloop at the second last param,
which is similar to occamsfuncerV2's curry op which used its second last param for types that way.
As of 2021-1-21 github.com/benrayfield/occamsfuncer is version 3 but doesnt say what its version is,
and it doesnt have that infloop in curry behavior cuz its an axiom related thing thats hard to prove things about.

	Same indexs as g(int) and g(long).
	This is a cache and can change from one moment to the next, and it does not affect
	the behaviors of l() r() g(int) in terms of λ.equals(λ) and λ.hashCode() but may affect efficiency.
	<br><br>
	UPDATE: renamed this from isLazy to isLoaded then renamed to isSkip.
	Is loaded into memory andOr already created by being observed?
	x and z can be loaded while y is not loaded and x.l()==y and y.l()==z, or r() childs or any combos of l and r.
	<br><br>
	Index 1 is not lazy cuz thats self. left of x is x*2. right of x is x*2+1.
	In Curnode, Pairnode, PairnodeWithFuncCache, etc, some nodes within a few hops of here are lazy,
	while their childs are not lazy, which is strange since in most systems
	you dont have eager->lazy->eager in a forest, but here its a way to match whats in memory
	with the math abstraction of the wikibinator104 universal function
	which if it were used directly would create a few times more nodes that are rarely used
	except to get to their childs. Dedup (the instant partial kind and lazy perfect kind by globalIds)
	will work with this lazy stuff, even though its a merkle forest,
	the default kind of id will be designed so that you only need the ids of the eager parts
	a little farther below (in Curnode, PairNode, etc) to derive the id of the eager node farther above them,
	such as a single bit to say if its left child is pair and the other bits are the same,
	or actually create the ids in the middle during the hashing but garbcol them as temp calculations,
	which are 2 ways to do it. This system will support an unlimited kinds of merkle ids
	used simultaneously and matching them with eachother at runtime,
	as an idMaker is any λ which when called on a λ (which may be itself or any λ)
	returns a λ thats the id (such as cbt256).
	<br><br>
	Another common example is cbt wrapping a double[] or int[] or byte[] or float[] or java.nio.Buffer,
	which will create wrappers that share the same array but different powOf2 size ranges of it,
	and I'm unsure if that will happen from bottom up or top down
	but in occamsfuncer its top down it creates l() or r() then recurses, which is inefficient
	compared to creating the one you want directly at a binheapIndex
	but I'm unsure if going directly to it might create dedup problems.
