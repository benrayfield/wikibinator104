/** immutable. binary forest node, defined ONLY by its forest shape, with no data in each node
except caches which can be derived from that shape.
A 7 param universal pattern combinator
(aka combinator, universal lambda function, and pattern calculus function)
whose first param is isDirty (leaf is clean, any nonleaf means dirty, which will be cached to
swap between clean vs dirty in bigo1), and leaf itself is clean.
The other 6 params are mostly the same as in earlier wikibinator versions
but will reorder some opcodes and put in
(axiomop ret param func) being halted if (func param)->ret
and (axiomop ret param func ignore) does infloop and that "ignore" param is the 7th of 7 params,
so unlike earlier wikibinator versions, it can infloop at the second last param,
which is similar to occamsfuncerV2's curry op which used its second last param for types that way.
As of 2021-1-21 github.com/benrayfield/occamsfuncer is version 3 but doesnt say what its version is,
and it doesnt have that infloop in curry behavior cuz its an axiom related thing thats hard to prove things about.
