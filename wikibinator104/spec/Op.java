	λret.λfunc.λparam.λignore.(S I I (S I I)) aka an infinite loop, to complete the 7 params of the universal func,
	but we dont normally call it all the way to λignore, just use the first 3.
	TODO explain λret.λfunc.λparam.(λret.λfunc.λparam.(λret.λfunc.λparam.(...))) differently
	cuz that way of writing it makes it appear that it takes 3 more params, instead of the 3 params already given.
	<br><br> 
	Theres a !isDirty and isDirty form of this. Theres nothing dirty about it, other than possibly its params.
	(ax ret param func) will eventually halt (and cache that) if (func param)->ret (use derived equals func).
	(ax ret param func ignore) does infloop, which completes the 7 params of the universal func.
	<br><br>
	Axiom op, such as (ax (leaf leaf) leaf) can only halt on params that (ax leaf leaf) cant halt on,
	(cuz same func and param can have at most 1 returnVal, but theres 2 in that case: leaf and (leaf leaf)),
	which together are similar to axiomforest's TruthValue.yes and TruthValue.no and together would TruthValue.bull,
	and if neither are observed then thats TruthValue.unknown. But in this software, theres only binary forest shape
	with no TruthValue or other data at nodes, except caches of what can be derived only from binary forest shape,
	but "can be mounted into axiomforest" (search for that) as explained in comment near end of this class.
	<br><br>
	This will normally be used with dovetailing of fntape to search all possible axioms provable in finite steps,
	and if that does not find the axiom you're requesting (by calling it on ret param func)
	then it infloops by not finding that or appears to infloop cuz it takes longer than the universe --> heatdeath,
	aka it calls (func param) then checks if what it returns (if it ever returns) equals ret,
	and the dovetailing would be implemented inside that func, in some cases,
	as axiomforest-like bloom-filter of accumulating true statements in (ax (leaf leaf) leaf)
	and accumulating false statements in (ax leaf leaf), and checking for overlap between those 2.
	That dovetailing, which will be derived at user level (see "fntape" in occamsfuncer readme),
	is just an abstract math description of what it must do and will actually be
	computed exponentially faster in many cases using Compiled.java manually written optimizations,
	and later deriving some of those optimizations automatically (to gpu, javassist, etc).
	Its easy to make something exponentially faster if you already know what you want it to do
	but it just happens to take exponential time and memory to write it in the form of dovetailing
	as a recognizer function of the the thing which a Compiled.java would compute procedurally forward,
	those things being the various axiom-like statements or their outputs like in earlier wikibinator versions
	where that got too complex and I redesigned it to only need this one ax op with exponential optimizations.
	<br><br>
	OLD...
	Ok, updated comments (changed from λret.λparam.λfunc) for...
	should it be (ax func ret param) is halted if (func param)->ret?
		cuz that way ret could be leaf and func is like a type,
		such as (ax ifItsACatPicThenReturnLeaf leaf aPossibleCatPic) would be halted
		only if (ifItsACatPicThenReturnLeaf aPossibleCatPic)->leaf,
		and it could hook into axiomforest similar as the other way like
		(ifItsACatPicThenReturnLeafElseLeafofleaf aPossibleCatPic)->(leaf leaf)
			if its certainly not a cat pic, and any return other than leaf or (leaf leaf) could mean unknown
			and if it never halts thats also unknown.
		Its still the same 3 params as (ax func ret param), or (ax ret func param) would also work,
		but func cant be the last one cuz func has control.
	Similarly func could be something that calls its param on another func, if you want it to do some other order.

	Other systems built in axiomforest, such as maybe a wikibinator105 someday,

	and TruthValue.unknown means dont know if its halted or not (which may take infinite time/memory to know),
	and TruthValue.bull works as usual. They all work as usual.
	There will be some duplication of the YES and NO in
	(wikibinatorOp.ax (wikibinatorLeaf wikibinatorLeaf) wikibinatorLeaf x)
	and (wikibinatorOp.ax wikibinatorLeaf wikibinatorLeaf x) will never both exist for any x.
	Other first params of wikibinatorOp are allowed too, but those 2 can emulate all the others in axiomforest way.
