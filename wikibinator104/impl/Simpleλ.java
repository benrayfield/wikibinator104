		//just so TruthValue.no can say they are an invalid node.
		//This could cause a problem for Op.ax since if its halted at second last param
		//that means that for 3 of its params ret func param: (func param)->ret,
		//and that usually cant be verified in bigo1 cuz it may never halt at all or halt in a million years,
		//so if allow creating that λ (a call of Op.ax on ret func param) before (func param) halts
		//then must store a bit (or maybe a TruthValue?) for has it halted yet,
		//and the design is theres no data in λ except what can be derived from the 2 childs below
		//when its created, aka caches derived from the binary forest shape of call pairs,
		//and technically if something halts or not is determined only by its forest shape
		//or at least in clean/deterministic mode (first param is not leaf).
